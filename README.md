# Project manegment for bioinformatics research

Here I upload some selfmade scripts that I use in my daily work, to organize and manege my own projects. I write the scripts as an strategy to apply my studies in a programming language and take advantage of maybe increase my productivity. 
I aim that someday I am able to contribute to a more inclusive data science, mainly regarding to biology and plant science. My simple scripts are devoloped for self use, but feel free to use and make them better. The idea behind them, besides developing my knowlegde in Python and Project Manegement, is to increase the efficiency of my own bioinformatics research projects.
